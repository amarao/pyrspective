Python code to generate SVG for perspective drafting/drawing

I'm learning how to draw. Perspective is really important but
I hate to draw all those help lines by myself, and do all other
drafting stuff. I decide to offload all that stuff to python.

This code based on svgwrite module of python and expects you have
something (inkscape) to open SVG files on your computer via xdg-open.

It not library or ready application - just code.

1prespective.py generates 1perspective.svg with 1 perspective
helper lines. All settings are done via init values in source code.
